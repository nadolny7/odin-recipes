    <h1>BREAD</h1>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p1>Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour (usually wheat) and water, usually by baking. 
        Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures' diet. 
        It is one of the oldest human-made foods, having been of significance since the dawn of agriculture, and plays an essential 
        role in both religious rituals and secular culture. Bread may be leavened by naturally occurring 
        microbes (e.g. sourdough), chemicals (e.g. baking soda), industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure aeration, which 
        creates the gas bubbles that fluff up bread. In many countries, commercial bread often contains additives to 
        improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of production.</p1>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
<h4>STEPS</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; 
        let stand until bubbles form on surface. Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, 
        salt and 3 cups flour. Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth.
         Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.
    </li>
    <li>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. 
        Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place 
        until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. 
        Shape each into a loaf. Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. 
        Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Bake at 375° until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an 
        internal temperature of 200°, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.

    <h1>PIZZA</h1>
    <H2>Description</H2>
<p1>Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a 
    usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often 
    various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, 
    vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a 
    wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known 
    as a pizzaiolo. In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, 
    and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut 
    into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.</p1>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Active dry yeast</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Bread Flour</li>
        <li>Grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Feta cheese</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Sliced black olives</li>
        <li>Fresh chopped basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. 
        Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
    </li>
    <li>dd the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed 
        for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza 
        dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. 
        Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.</li>
    <li>After the pizza dough has risen, you can freeze it to use later. 
        Divide the dough in half (or the portion sizes you will be using to make your pizzas). 
        Place on parchment paper or a lightly floured dish and place, uncovered, in the freezer 
        for 15 to 20 minutes. Then remove from the freezer, and place in individual freezer bags, 
        removing as much air as you can from the bags. 
        Return to the freezer and store for up to 3 months.</li>
        <li>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each 
            pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way.

        </li>
        <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands 
            on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your 
            fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not 
            stretch further.Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the 
            desired diameter—10 to 12 inches.</li>
